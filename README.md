 All codes I created for the latest projects

Hi! 

My name is Machteld Dalhuisen, and this Github folder are examples of work that I have created. 

Currently there are three projects, Thief, Catiator and DRI-VR

Thief is a project in which a character walks around a level to collect items while trying not to get caught by the guards. 

Catiator is a project in which four players battle each other. 

DRI-VR is a VR project during which the player gets to see a 3D video in which they have to point at certain directions.
